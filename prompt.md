Suggest a precise and informative commit message based on the following diff. Do not use markdown syntax in your response.

The commit message should have description with a short title that follows conventional commit message format like `<type>`[scope]: `<description>`.

Type:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

Examples:

- fix(authentication): add 403 forbidden error cases
- feat(ai): generate commit messages from changes

If necessary, follow with an explanatory body providing insight into the nature of the changes, the reasoning behind them, and any significant consequences or considerations arising from them.
